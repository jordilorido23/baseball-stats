# Reliever FA Analysis: V1 vs V2 Comparison

**Date:** November 13, 2025
**Purpose:** Show what the TRUE deep-dive (V2) adds over the initial analysis (V1)

---

## Executive Summary

**V1 (Initial Analysis):**
- Single-year snapshot (2025 only)
- 48 FA relievers matched
- Basic metrics: ERA, FIP, K%, BB%, saves, role mismatch
- **Result:** Good analysis, but missing trend context

**V2 (TRUE Deep Dive):**
- Multi-year trends (2021-2025: 5 years)
- Same 48 FA relievers, but with 60+ additional trend columns
- Advanced insights: Sticky stuff adaptation, velocity trends, K% breakouts, workload forensics, arsenal evolution
- **Result:** Edge-providing analysis with predictive signals

---

## Key Differences: What V2 Adds

### 1. Multi-Year Velocity Trends

**V1:** Only knew 2025 fastball velocity (FBv column)

**V2:** Tracks FBv from 2023→2024→2025
- **Velocity Trend 3yr:** Did velocity increase/decrease/stay stable?
- **Classification:** Declining (Red Flag), Declining (Warning), Stable, Improving

**Example from V2 Analysis:**
- **Hunter Harvey:** 96.2 mph current, but -2.1 mph over 3 years (RED FLAG despite good 2025 results)
- **Robert Suarez:** 98.6 mph current, +1.0 mph over 3 years (IMPROVING - positive signal)
- **Phil Maton:** 90.4 mph current, +1.4 mph over 3 years (IMPROVING - breakout signal)

**Edge:** V2 caught Hunter Harvey's declining velocity that V1 missed. This is an injury/decline signal despite his 0.00 ERA in 2025.

---

### 2. Sticky Stuff Era Adaptation (2021-2025)

**V1:** No context on how pitcher adapted to 2021 sticky stuff enforcement

**V2:** Tracks K% from 2021 (pre-enforcement) → 2022 (shock year) → 2025 (adaptation)
- **K% Drop 2021→2022:** How much did sticky stuff hurt them?
- **K% Recovery 2022→2025:** Did they adapt successfully?
- **Classification:** Adapted Successfully, Still Struggling, Not Sticky Reliant, Partial Adaptation

**Example from V2 Analysis:**
- **Craig Kimbrel:** -14.9% K% drop in 2022, +7.0% recovery by 2025 (ADAPTED SUCCESSFULLY)
- **Gregory Soto:** -4.7% K% drop in 2022, +2.3% recovery by 2025 (ADAPTED SUCCESSFULLY)
- **Raisel Iglesias:** Still struggling with adaptation (AVOID)

**Edge:** V2 identifies pitchers who overcame the hardest challenge in modern MLB. This shows adaptability, work ethic, coaching quality.

---

### 3. K% Trend Analysis (Stuff Evolution)

**V1:** Only knew 2025 K%

**V2:** Tracks K% from 2023→2024→2025
- **K% Trend 3yr:** Did strikeout rate improve/decline?
- **Classification:** Improving (Breakout), Stable, Declining (Warning), Declining (Stuff Loss)

**Example from V2 Analysis:**
- **Robert Suarez:** +5.7 percentage points K% improvement (BREAKOUT)
- **Phil Maton:** +5.7 percentage points K% improvement (BREAKOUT)
- **Shelby Miller:** +7.2 percentage points K% improvement (BREAKOUT)

**Edge:** V2 catches late-career breakouts that V1 missed. These are guys adding new pitches or getting better coaching.

---

### 4. Workload Forensics (3-Year Cumulative)

**V1:** Only knew 2025 IP and appearances

**V2:** Sums IP and appearances from 2023-2025
- **Cumulative IP 3yr:** Total workload over 3 years
- **Cumulative G 3yr:** Total appearances over 3 years
- **Classification:** Extreme Workload (240+ IP), High Workload (200+ IP), Normal

**Example from V2 Data:**
- Can identify relievers with 240+ IP over 3 years (fatigue bombs)
- Can identify guys with high-appearance frequency (back-to-back usage patterns)

**Edge:** V2 identifies cumulative fatigue that single-year analysis misses.

---

### 5. Arsenal Evolution (Pitch Additions/Drops)

**V1:** Knew arsenal diversity in 2025 only

**V2:** Compares pitch usage 2023 vs 2025
- **Pitches Added:** New pitches used >10% in 2025 but not 2023
- **Pitches Dropped:** Pitches used >10% in 2023 but not 2025
- **Arsenal Evolution Score:** +20 pts per pitch added, -10 pts per pitch dropped

**Example from V2 Analysis:**
- **Justin Wilson:** Added slider (SL) between 2023-2025
- **Hoby Milner:** Added changeup (CH) between 2023-2025
- **Ryan Borucki:** Added changeup (CH) between 2023-2025

**Edge:** V2 rewards pitchers evolving their arsenals (breakout potential).

## New Insights from V2 (That V1 Completely Missed)

### 1. Velocity Declining Red Flags

**Identified by V2 Only:**
- Hunter Harvey: -2.1 mph (despite 0.00 ERA in 2025)
- Kenley Jansen: -2.1 mph
- Craig Kimbrel: -2.4 mph
- Andrew Chafin: -2.6 mph
- David Robertson: -2.8 mph

**Why This Matters:** Declining velocity = injury risk, even if current results look good.

### 2. Late-Career Breakouts (K% Improving)

**Identified by V2 Only:**
- Robert Suarez: +5.7% K% (age 34 breakout!)
- Phil Maton: +5.7% K% (age 32 breakout!)
- Shelby Miller: +7.2% K% (age 34 renaissance!)
- Justin Wilson: +3.1% K% (age 37, added slider)

**Why This Matters:** These are guys getting BETTER, not declining.

### 3. Sticky Stuff Adaptation Winners

**Identified by V2 Only:**
- Craig Kimbrel: Overcame -14.9% K% drop, recovered +7.0%

**Why This Matters:** Shows adaptability, work ethic, coaching quality.

###4. Sticky Stuff Losers (Still Struggling)

**Identified by V2 Only:**
- Raisel Iglesias: Still struggling with sticky stuff adaptation
- Hoby Milner: Still struggling

**Why This Matters:** These guys never fully recovered from 2021 enforcement.

### 5. Arsenal Evolution (Added Pitches)

**Identified by V2 Only:**
