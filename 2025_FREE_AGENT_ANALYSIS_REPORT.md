**Analysis Date:** November 13, 2025
**Analyst:** Baseball Analytics Portfolio
**Methodology:** Expected Stats Analysis, Aging Curves, Contract Valuations

---

## Executive Summary

The 2025-2026 MLB free agent class features **62 notable players** across all positions, headlined by elite talent like **Kyle Tucker** (8.7 WAR), **Dylan Cease** (8.1 WAR), and **Alex Bregman** (7.7 WAR). This comprehensive analysis evaluates each player through the lens of:

- **Expected statistics (xStats)** - Separating luck from skill
- **Aging curves** - Position-specific decline projections
- **Contract valuations** - Fair market value estimates using $8M/WAR baseline
- **Value scoring** - Composite metric ranking FA class

### Key Findings

#### 💎 Elite Tier (Max Contract Candidates)
- **Kyle Tucker** (OF, 29) - 8.7 WAR, true superstar entering prime
- **Dylan Cease** (SP, 30) - 8.1 WAR, elite pitcher worth $200M+ commitment
- **Alex Bregman** (3B, 32) - 7.7 WAR but age concern, 5-year max
- **Framber Valdez** (SP, 32) - 7.7 WAR, innings workhorse
- **Eugenio Suarez** (3B, 34) - 7.6 WAR but cliff risk, shorter deal
- **Ranger Suarez** (SP, 30) - 7.5 WAR, breakout pitcher

**Recommendation:** These players justify $25M+ AAV deals. Tucker and Cease are the only true long-term max contract candidates.

#### 📈 Buy-Low Opportunities
Players with positive expected stats gaps (unlucky 2025 results):
- Elite contact quality metrics (barrel rate 10%+, exit velo 90+ mph)
- Actual performance below expected due to BABIP/sequencing luck
- Age 30 or younger with remaining prime years
- **Target:** 4-5 year deals at 15-20% below market rate

**Strategy:** These players offer surplus value for analytically-driven teams. Expect 15-20 point wOBA improvement in 2026 purely from regression to mean.

#### ⚠️ Regression Risks
Players whose 2025 results exceeded underlying metrics:
- Negative xStats gaps (actual > expected)
- Weak contact quality despite good traditional stats
- Age 33+ with declining skills
- **Risk:** 15-25% performance drop in 2026

**Strategy:** Avoid multi-year commitments. Let competitors overpay for unsustainable results.

#### 🎯 Value Tier Recommendations
- **Premium tier** (Chris Bassitt, Michael King, Gleyber Torres): Quality starters worth $15-25M AAV
- **Mid-tier** (Anthony Santander, Christian Walker, Willy Adames): Solid options at $12-20M AAV
- **Value tier** (Veterans 35+): 1-2 year prove-it deals only

## Position-by-Position Breakdown

### Catchers
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| J.T. Realmuto | 35 | 4.0 | Declining | 2yr / $40M |
| Victor Caratini | 32 | 2.7 | Solid backup | 2yr / $12M |
| Danny Jansen | 31 | 1.8 | Platoon/backup | 2yr / $8M |

**Analysis:** Realmuto is the clear top option but age 35 with catcher's steep decline curve makes him risky beyond 2 years. Caratini offers solid value as backup/platoon piece.

**Recommendation:** Realmuto 2yr/$40M or Caratini 2yr/$12M depending on budget/role needs.

---

### First Base
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Pete Alonso | 31 | 5.6 | Elite power | 5yr / $150M |
| Josh Naylor | 29 | 5.4 | Entering prime | 6yr / $145M |
| Ryan O'Hearn | 32 | 4.6 | Solid | 4yr / $70M |
| Christian Walker | 34 | 4.2 | Short-term value | 3yr / $60M |
| Paul Goldschmidt | 37 | 1.5 | Veteran depth | 1yr / $10M |

**Analysis:** Alonso and Naylor are the premium options. Alonso has elite power but plays premium position poorly. Naylor younger with better defensive profile. Walker excellent short-term choice for contenders.

**Recommendation:**
- **Rebuilders:** Naylor (6yr/$145M) - age 29, full prime ahead
- **Contenders:** Walker (3yr/$60M) + O'Hearn platoon
- **Budget:** Goldschmidt prove-it deal

---

### Second Base
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Gleyber Torres | 29 | 4.4 | Entering prime | 6yr / $125M |
| Whit Merrifield | 34 | 1.5 | Veteran utility | 2yr / $15M |

**Analysis:** Torres is the clear target at 2B. Age 29 with solid defense and improving bat. Multi-positional flexibility adds value. Merrifield veteran depth piece only.

**Recommendation:** Torres 6yr/$125M ($21M AAV) - undervalued compared to other premium INF

---

### Shortstop
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Willy Adames | 29 | 3.8 | Plus defender | 7yr / $180M |
| Ha-Seong Kim | 30 | 3.5 | Elite defense | 6yr / $140M |
| Miguel Rojas | 37 | 4.5 | Veteran utility | 2yr / $22M |

**Analysis:** Premium defensive position with two strong options. Adames age 29 with power/defense combo. Kim age 30 elite defender with contact skills. Both worth long-term investment due to positional scarcity.

**Recommendation:**
- **High budget:** Adames 7yr/$180M - better offensive profile
- **Mid budget:** Kim 6yr/$140M - elite defense, underrated bat
- **Depth:** Rojas short-term

---

### Third Base
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Alex Bregman | 32 | 7.7 | Elite but aging | 5yr / $195M |
| Eugenio Suarez | 34 | 7.6 | Cliff risk | 4yr / $150M |
| Justin Turner | 40 | 1.0 | Depth only | 1yr / $7M |

**Analysis:** Two elite options but both have significant age concerns. Bregman age 32 still in late prime but decline coming. Suarez age 34 approaching cliff - massive risk on long deal.

**Recommendation:**
- **Bregman:** 5yr max ($39M AAV) - years 4-5 will decline
- **Suarez:** 3-4yr only ($35M AAV) - avoid 5+ years at all costs
- Consider internal options or trade market instead

---

### Outfield
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Kyle Tucker | 29 | 8.7 | Superstar | 7-8yr / $300M |
| Cody Bellinger | 30 | 7.0 | Elite two-way | 6yr / $185M |
| Kyle Schwarber | 33 | 8.3 | DH/platoon | 4yr / $110M |
| Anthony Santander | 30 | 4.5 | Power bat | 5yr / $105M |
| Harrison Bader | 32 | 4.4 | Defense-first | 3yr / $40M |
| Trent Grisham | 29 | 3.7 | Glove/speed | 4yr / $50M |
| Teoscar Hernandez | 32 | 4.0 | Power/DH | 4yr / $75M |
| Rob Refsnyder | 35 | 2.3 | Platoon | 1yr / $5M |
| Tommy Pham | 37 | 1.0 | Depth | 1yr / $4M |
| Jesse Winker | 35 | 0.8 | Platoon DH | 1yr / $6M |

**Analysis:**
- **Tucker** is the #1 FA overall - true five-tool player entering age 29 season
- **Bellinger** elite defender with improving bat, age 30 sweet spot
- **Schwarber** DH primarily but elite OBP/power, shorter deal due to age
- **Santander** switch-hitter with 30+ HR power, undervalued
- Veterans (35+) should be 1-2 year deals only

**Recommendation:**
- **Max contract:** Tucker 7yr/$300M+ (generational talent)
- **Premium:** Bellinger 6yr/$185M (two-way value)
- **Value:** Santander 5yr/$105M (power upside, switch-hitting)
- **Short-term:** Schwarber 4yr/$110M (DH/platoon role)

### Designated Hitter
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Kyle Schwarber | 33 | 8.3 | Elite OBP/power | 4yr / $110M |
| Marcell Ozuna | 35 | 5.9 | Power bat | 3yr / $75M |
| J.D. Martinez | 37 | 1.2 | Veteran | 1yr / $8M |

**Analysis:** Schwarber elite DH option with patience and power. Ozuna age 35 but productive bat. Martinez veteran depth.

**Recommendation:** DH-only players age poorly - keep contracts short. Schwarber 4yr max, Ozuna 3yr, JDM 1yr.

---

### Starting Pitchers

#### Elite Tier (Aces)
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|

**Analysis:**
- **Cease** age 30 elite stuff (strikeout rate, fastball velo), durable
- **Valdez** workhorse (200+ IP), sinkerball approach ages well
- **Suarez** breakout 2025, elite control, age 30 entering prime
- **Burnes** proven track record, four-pitch mix
- **Fried** consistent mid-rotation ace, injury history concern
- **Snell** volatile but elite ceiling, age 32 risk

**Recommendation:**
- **Top target:** Cease 6yr/$220M - best age/stuff combo
- **Innings:** Valdez 6yr/$210M - 200+ IP annually
- **Value:** Ranger Suarez 6yr/$195M - breakout with sustainability
- **Risk/reward:** Snell 5yr max - injury/consistency concerns

#### Premium Tier (Quality Starters)
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Nick Martinez | 35 | 5.5 | Versatile | 3yr / $80M |
| Chris Bassitt | 37 | 4.8 | Veteran SP | 2yr / $50M |
| Michael King | 31 | 4.7 | Reliever → SP | 5yr / $120M |
| Walker Buehler | 31 | 3.0 | Post-injury | 2yr / $40M (incentives) |

**Analysis:**
- **Martinez** age 35 but unique SP/RP flex value
- **Bassitt** age 37, short-term innings eater
- **King** converted reliever, durability question
- **Buehler** Tommy John recovery, prove-it deal

**Recommendation:** Target King (5yr/$120M) for upside, Martinez (3yr/$80M) for flexibility

#### Mid-Tier Starters
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Jack Flaherty | 29 | 3.5 | Inconsistent | 4yr / $80M |
| Shane Bieber | 30 | 3.2 | Post-TJ | 2yr / $45M |
| Luis Severino | 31 | 2.8 | Injury risk | 3yr / $55M |
| Nathan Eovaldi | 35 | 2.5 | Veteran | 2yr / $35M |
| Sean Manaea | 33 | 2.8 | Back-end SP | 3yr / $45M |
| Nick Pivetta | 32 | 3.0 | Streaky | 3yr / $42M |

**Analysis:** Injury histories and inconsistency make these players risky for long-term deals. Target 2-3 year commitments only.

**Recommendation:** Flaherty 4yr/$80M if health checks pass, otherwise Manaea 3yr/$45M for stability

#### Value Tier (Back-End / Depth)
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Jose Quintana | 37 | 3.2 | Innings eater | 2yr / $25M |
| Andrew Heaney | 34 | 3.0 | Injury prone | 1yr / $12M |
| Max Scherzer | 41 | 2.5 | Future HOF | 1yr / $15M |
| Charlie Morton | 42 | 2.8 | Veteran | 1yr / $15M |

| Yusei Kikuchi | 34 | 2.5 | Wildcard | 2yr / $22M |
| Kyle Gibson | 38 | 2.0 | Innings eater | 2yr / $20M |
| Michael Lorenzen | 33 | 1.5 | Swingman | 2yr / $15M |

**Analysis:** Veterans 35+ on 1-2 year deals. Scherzer/Morton/Verlander can still eat innings but avoid multi-year commitments.

**Recommendation:** 1-year deals for 35+ crowd, 2 years max for younger depth options

---

### Relief Pitchers
| Player | Age | 2025 WAR | Projection | Contract Estimate |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Edwin Diaz | 32 | 3.5 | Elite closer | 4yr / $65M |

| David Robertson | 40 | 1.3 | Veteran | 1yr / $8M |
| Andrew Chafin | 34 | 1.2 | LOOGY/setup | 2yr / $12M |

**Analysis:** Reliever volatility makes 4+ year deals risky. Diaz is elite but age 32. Scott/Holmes younger with upside.

**Recommendation:**
- **Elite closer:** Diaz 4yr/$65M or Holmes 4yr/$45M (younger)
- **Setup:** Hoffman 3yr/$38M, Estevez 3yr/$36M
- **Veterans:** 1-2 years only

## Contract Valuation Methodology

### $/WAR Market Rate
- **Current market:** $8.0M per WAR (2025-26 FA class baseline)
- **Inflation adjustment:** 5% annually (accounts for rising salary cap)
- **Position premiums:** SS/CF +10%, C/DH -10%
- **Age discounts:** 33-35 (-15%), 36+ (-30%)

### Aging Curve Decline Rates (Annual)
| Position | Decline Rate | Peak Age | Cliff Age |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| SP | 8% per year | 27-29 | 33-35 |
| RP | 10% per year | 26-28 | 31-33 |
| C | 7% per year | 27-29 | 32-34 |
| 1B | 5% per year | 28-30 | 33-35 |
| 2B | 6% per year | 27-29 | 32-34 |
| 3B | 6% per year | 28-30 | 33-35 |
| SS | 6% per year | 27-29 | 32-34 |
| OF | 5% per year | 27-30 | 33-36 |
| DH | 4% per year | 29-32 | 36-38 |

### Multi-Year Projection Formula

For a player with current WAR of **W₀**, age **A**, position decline rate **d**, over **Y** years:

```
Year 1: W₁ = W₀ × (1 - d)⁰ = W₀
Year 2: W₂ = W₀ × (1 - d)¹
Year 3: W₃ = W₀ × (1 - d)²
...
Year Y: Wʏ = W₀ × (1 - d)^(Y-1)

Total WAR = Σ(W₀ × (1-d)^(i-1)) for i=1 to Y
Contract Value = Total WAR × $/WAR × (1 + inflation)^avg_year
```

**Example:** Kyle Tucker, 8.7 WAR, age 29, OF (5% decline), 7-year deal

| Year | Age | Projected WAR | $/WAR | Value |
|------|-----|---------------|-------|-------|
| 2026 | 29 | 8.7 | $8.0M | $69.6M |
| 2027 | 30 | 8.3 | $8.4M | $69.7M |
| 2028 | 31 | 7.8 | $8.8M | $68.6M |
| 2029 | 32 | 7.4 | $9.2M | $68.1M |
| 2030 | 33 | 7.0 | $9.7M | $67.9M |
| 2031 | 34 | 6.7 | $10.2M | $68.3M |
| 2032 | 35 | 6.3 | $10.7M | $67.4M |
| **Total** | - | **52.2 WAR** | - | **$479M** |

**Fair contract:** 7yr / $480M ($68.6M AAV)

**Note:** Tucker will likely sign for less due to market inefficiencies, making him potential surplus value even at $300M.

## Expected Stats Analysis Framework

### What Are Expected Stats?

Baseball Savant's **expected statistics (xStats)** use exit velocity, launch angle, and sprint speed to calculate what a player's results *should have been* based purely on batted ball quality:

- **xBA (expected batting average)** - Based on similar batted balls historically
- **xSLG (expected slugging)** - Based on exit velo + launch angle
- **xwOBA (expected weighted on-base average)** - Comprehensive contact quality metric

### The xStats Gap

**Gap = Expected Stat - Actual Stat**

- **Positive gap** (+0.020 or more) = Player was **unlucky**
  - Hit ball hard consistently but results didn't show it
  - BABIP luck, defensive positioning, sample randomness
  - **Buy-low candidate** - likely to improve without skill change

- **Negative gap** (-0.020 or more) = Player was **lucky**
  - Results exceeded quality of contact
  - Weak contact found holes, batted ball luck
  - **Regression risk** - likely to decline

### Quality of Contact Metrics

**Barrel Rate** - Optimal exit velo + launch angle combo
- Elite: 15%+
- Above avg: 10-15%
- Average: 7-10%
- Below avg: <7%

**Exit Velocity**
- Elite: 93+ mph average
- Above avg: 91-93 mph
- Average: 89-91 mph
- Below avg: <89 mph

**Hard-Hit Rate** - % of batted balls 95+ mph
- Elite: 50%+
- Above avg: 45-50%
- Average: 40-45%
- Below avg: <40%

### Buy-Low Identification Criteria

A player is a **buy-low candidate** if:
1. ✅ xwOBA gap ≥ +0.020 (unlucky)
2. ✅ Barrel rate ≥ 10% (quality contact)
3. ✅ Age ≤ 32 (pre-aging cliff)
4. ✅ Exit velocity ≥ 90 mph (hard contact)

**Rationale:** These players possess elite underlying skills but had unlucky 2025 results. Expect 15-20 point wOBA regression upward in 2026 without any skill improvement.

**Contract strategy:** Target 4-5 year deals at 15-20% discount to market rate. When regression occurs, you acquire elite production at mid-tier prices.

### Regression Risk Identification

A player is a **regression risk** if:
1. ⚠️ xwOBA gap ≤ -0.020 (lucky)
2. ⚠️ Barrel rate ≤ 6% (weak contact)
3. ⚠️ Age ≥ 33 (aging cliff)
4. ⚠️ Exit velocity ≤ 88 mph (soft contact)

**Rationale:** These players benefited from batted ball luck in 2025. Their traditional stats look good but underlying skills are declining. Expect 15-25% performance decline in 2026.

**Contract strategy:** Avoid multi-year commitments. Let competitors overpay for unsustainable results. If signing, include heavy opt-outs and performance incentives.

## Strategic Recommendations by Team Type

### For Championship Contenders (2-3 Year Window)

**Philosophy:** Maximize 2026-2028 performance. Willing to sacrifice long-term flexibility for immediate production.

**Targets:**
1. **Elite tier FAs** - Tucker, Cease, Bregman (even if overpaying years 5-7)
2. **Win-now veterans** - Bassitt, Martinez, Realmuto on 2-3 year deals
3. **Proven performers** - Avoid prospect gambling, minimize xStats variance

**Contract structure:**
- Front-load deals (pay more in years 1-3, less in 4-7)
- Accept negative surplus value in years 5+ if years 1-3 contribute to championship
- Limit no-trade clauses (may need to move declining vets later)

**Sample strategy:**
- **$50M:** Kyle Tucker 7yr/$300M (superstar)
- **$35M:** Dylan Cease 6yr/$210M (ace)
- **$25M:** Pete Alonso 5yr/$125M (middle order power)
- **$25M:** Chris Bassitt 2yr/$50M (veteran depth)
- **$15M:** Tanner Scott 4yr/$52M (closer)
- **Total:** $150M annual commitment for elite core

**Risk:** Payroll inflexibility 2028-2032, but if it produces 2026-27 championships, worth it.

---

### For Rebuilding Teams (4+ Years from Contention)

**Philosophy:** Accumulate surplus value and tradeable assets. Do NOT pay for prime years you won't use.

**Targets:**
1. **Buy-low FAs age 28-31** - Sign undervalued players on 4-5 year deals
2. **Trade chips** - Players who will rebound in 2026-27 and be flippable at deadline
3. **Avoid:** Max contracts for anyone, age 32+ players, pitchers with injury history

**Contract structure:**
- **No no-trade clauses** - Must be able to flip at deadline
- Front-load salary (pay more early, easier to trade later)
- 4-5 year deals (sell high in years 2-3, bad years 4-5 don't matter for rebuild)

**Sample strategy:**
- Sign **3-4 buy-low candidates** at $15-20M AAV (players with positive xStats gaps)
- When they rebound to 3-5 WAR in 2026-27, trade at deadline
- Receive Top 100 prospects + absorb salary
- Net result: Turn cash into prospect capital

**Example:**
- Sign Josh Naylor 6yr/$145M ($24M AAV)
- Naylor posts 5+ WAR in 2026-27 (xStats rebound)
- Trade at 2027 deadline: Receive Top 75 prospect + PTBNL, absorb $40M remaining
- Value created: Turned $100M cash → Top prospect + $40M salary relief for buyer

**Risk:** If xStats analysis is wrong, stuck with declining assets. Need strong analytics infrastructure.

---

### For Mid-Market Teams ($120-160M Payroll)

**Philosophy:** Exploit market inefficiencies. You can't afford max contracts, so you MUST find value.

**Targets:**
1. **Buy-low candidates** - Your bread and butter
2. **Mid-tier FAs with positive xStats gaps** - $12-25M AAV range
3. **Avoid:** Bidding wars for elite FAs, age 35+ veterans, regression risks

**Contract structure:**
- Target $15-22M AAV range (where fewer teams compete)
- Prioritize 4-5 year deals (long enough for surplus value, short enough to avoid back-end albatross)
- Insist on performance-based opt-outs (if player exceeds projections, you already won)

**Sample roster construction:**
- **4 buy-low FAs:** $80M payroll, $100M production (if xStats correct)
- **2 homegrown stars:** $30M, $40M production
- **1 market-rate FA:** $25M, $25M production
- **Depth/rookies:** $15M, $20M production
- **Total:** $150M payroll → $185M production = 90+ wins

**Key insight:** The $35M production surplus is the difference between 85 and 90 wins. That's Wild Card vs missing playoffs.

**Sample targets (2025-26):**
- **Anthony Santander** 5yr/$105M - switch-hitter, power, age 30
- **Gleyber Torres** 6yr/$125M - multi-position, age 29, underrated
- **Michael King** 5yr/$120M - SP upside, age 31
- **Tanner Scott** 4yr/$52M - high-leverage RP
- **Christian Walker** 3yr/$60M - short-term 1B production

**Total:** $115M for core pieces, leaves $35M for depth and rookies

**Risk:** Requires excellent analytics infrastructure. If you misidentify buy-low candidates, you're just overpaying for declining players.

## Market Inefficiencies to Exploit

### 1. Traditional Stats vs xStats Gap

**Inefficiency:** Most teams still overweight traditional stats (BA, RBI, ERA) vs expected stats.

**Opportunity:** Find players with:
- Low BA but high xBA (unlucky BABIP)
- Low RBI but high barrel rate (lineup/opportunity dependent)
- High ERA but good xFIP/xERA (poor defense/sequencing)

**Example archetype:** Player with .245/.330/.450 slash but:
- xBA .270
- Barrel rate 12% (elite)
- Exit velo 92 mph
- BABIP .260 (30 points below league average)

**Market value:** $18M AAV based on traditional stats
**True value:** $26M AAV based on expected stats and contact quality
**Surplus opportunity:** $8M annually

---

### 2. Age Cliff Timing

**Inefficiency:** Teams sign 32-33 year olds to 6-7 year deals despite aging curve data showing cliff at 33-35.

**Opportunity:** Target players age 28-30 on longer deals. Avoid 33+ on deals beyond 4 years.

**Example:**
- **Bad contract:** Alex Bregman 7yr/$275M (age 32-39) - Years 5-7 will be disaster
- **Good contract:** Gleyber Torres 6yr/$125M (age 29-34) - Ages 29-32 are prime years

**Surplus created:** Torres provides 24 WAR over 6 years ($192M value at $8M/WAR) for $125M cost = **$67M surplus**

---

### 3. Positional Value Premiums

**Inefficiency:** Market undervalues premium defensive positions (SS, CF, C) and overvalues offense-only positions (1B, DH).

**Opportunity:**
- Pay premium for elite defenders at SS/CF/C
- Avoid overpaying for 1B/DH with poor defense

**Example:**
- Willy Adames (SS, elite defense) 7yr/$180M = $26M AAV
- Pete Alonso (1B, poor defense) 5yr/$150M = $30M AAV

**Value:** Adames provides defensive WAR (15-20 runs annually) that Alonso doesn't. If offense is equal, Adames is worth $5M+ more per year.

---

### 4. Reliever Volatility

**Inefficiency:** Teams sign relievers to 4-5 year deals despite 10% annual decline rate and high volatility.

**Opportunity:** Avoid multi-year reliever deals beyond 3 years. Stream relievers on 1-2 year deals.

**Example:**
- **Bad approach:** Pay closer $18M AAV × 5 years = $90M
- **Good approach:** Sign 3 relievers at $6M AAV × 2 years, replace as needed

**Risk mitigation:** If one reliever flames out, you're only on hook for 1-2 years, not 5.

---

### 5. Starting Pitcher Injury Risk

**Inefficiency:** Teams give long-term deals to pitchers with injury history or high innings loads.

**Opportunity:**
- Target pitchers with clean injury history
- Include innings limits and performance incentives
- Avoid SP over age 33 on 5+ year deals

**Red flags:**
- Previous Tommy John surgery
- 200+ innings in 3 consecutive years (fatigue risk)
- Velocity decline of 2+ mph
- Age 34+ (sharp decline ahead)

**Example:**
- **Avoid:** Blake Snell 6yr/$180M (age 32, injury history) - Years 4-6 disaster risk
- **Target:** Ranger Suarez 6yr/$195M (age 30, clean health, improving) - Safer bet

## Risk Management Strategies

### Contract Structure Best Practices

#### 1. Opt-Outs (Player and Team)

**Player opt-outs** (after years 2-3):
- **Pro:** If player exceeds expectations, they opt out (you already got surplus value)
- **Con:** If player declines, they stay (you're stuck)
- **Use case:** High-upside signings where you win if they perform well

**Team opt-outs** (after years 3-4):
- **Pro:** If player declines, you can cut losses
- **Con:** Hard to negotiate, players demand higher AAV
- **Use case:** Aging players (32+) where cliff risk is high

**Example:** Alex Bregman 6yr/$240M with player opt-out after year 3
- Years 1-3 at age 32-34: Likely productive
- If healthy/productive: He opts out, you got 3 elite years
- If declining: He stays, but you got 3 good years + 3 bad (net positive)

---

#### 2. Performance Incentives

**Structure:** Base salary + incentives for games played, WAR thresholds, awards

**Example:**
- Base: $20M AAV
- Incentives: +$3M for 150+ games, +$2M for 4+ WAR, +$2M for All-Star
- Actual pay: $20-27M depending on performance

**Benefit:** Align player incentives with team goals, reduce risk if player declines

---

#### 3. Deferred Money

**Structure:** Pay portion of contract 5-10 years after signing

**Example:** 10yr/$300M contract with $100M deferred
- Annual cash outlay: $20M
- Actual total obligation: $300M (but reduced present value)

**Benefit:** Reduces present-day payroll burden, allows more flexibility

**Risk:** Still on hook if player flames out (see Bobby Bonilla)

---

#### 4. Front-Loading vs Back-Loading

**Front-load** (pay more in early years):
- **Use for:** Contending teams who need production NOW
- **Benefit:** Easier to trade player later with lower salary
- **Example:** 6yr deal - $40M, $35M, $30M, $25M, $20M, $20M = $170M total

**Back-load** (pay more in later years):
- **Use for:** Rebuilding teams managing current payroll
- **Benefit:** Lower early payroll impact
- **Risk:** Player declining in high-salary years
- **Example:** 6yr deal - $20M, $20M, $25M, $30M, $35M, $40M = $170M total

---

### Injury Risk Mitigation

#### Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Previous Tommy John surgery** (SP/RP)
   - 25-30% chance of re-injury
   - Velocity often doesn't fully return
   - Limit to 4-5 year deals maximum

2. **Multiple IL stints** (any position)
   - Player with 3+ IL stints in past 3 years = high risk
   - Include games played incentives

3. **Age 32+ with declining exit velo** (hitters)
   - 2+ mph exit velo drop = skill erosion
   - Avoid deals longer than 3-4 years

4. **High innings workload** (SP)
   - 200+ IP in 4+ consecutive years = fatigue risk
   - Monitor for velocity decline, injury spike in year 5-6

#### Protective Contract Clauses

- **Games played minimums** - Player must play 120+ games to earn full salary
- **Medical reviews** - Annual physicals with team doctors
- **Rehab assignment terms** - Clear timeline for return from injury
- **Voided options** - If player misses 100+ games due to injury, team options void

## Conclusion: Winning the 2025-26 Free Agent Market

### The Formula for Success

**Championship contenders:**
1. Identify THE difference-maker (Tucker, Cease, Bregman)
2. Pay market rate (or slight overpay) to secure them
3. Supplement with 2-3 year veterans who fit win-now window
4. Accept that years 5-7 may be negative surplus if years 1-3 produce championships

**Rebuilding teams:**
1. Target buy-low candidates age 28-31 with positive xStats gaps
2. Sign to 4-5 year deals at 15% discount to market
3. Flip at trade deadline in years 2-3 when value peaks
4. Convert cash into prospect capital systematically

**Mid-market teams:**
1. Build analytical edge (quality of contact metrics, xStats gaps, aging curves)
2. Target the $15-25M AAV tier where fewer teams compete
3. Accumulate 3-4 buy-low candidates to generate $30-40M surplus annually
4. That surplus = 85 win roster → 90 win roster = playoff contention

### Key Insights

✅ **Expected stats matter more than traditional stats** for multi-year contracts

✅ **Aging curves are predictable** - use them to determine contract length

✅ **Market inefficiencies exist** - most teams still overweight BA/RBI/narrative

✅ **Position matters** - pay premium for SS/CF, avoid overpaying 1B/DH

✅ **Age 32 is the key threshold** - cliff risk accelerates dramatically after this

### The 2025-26 Free Agent Market Winners

**Best signings to make:**
- Kyle Tucker 7yr/$300M (generational talent, age 29)
- Dylan Cease 6yr/$220M (elite pitcher, age 30)
- Gleyber Torres 6yr/$125M (undervalued, age 29)
- Josh Naylor 6yr/$145M (prime ahead, age 29)
- Ranger Suarez 6yr/$195M (breakout with sustainability)

**Worst signings to avoid:**
- Eugenio Suarez 6+ years (age 34 cliff risk)
- Max Scherzer/Charlie Morton 3+ years (age 41-42, variance too high)
- Any reliever 5+ years (volatility and decline rate too steep)
- Blake Snell 6+ years (age 32, injury history)

### Final Thought

The 2025-26 free agent market will reward teams that:
1. Trust data over traditional scouting narratives
2. Apply aging curves rigorously to contract length decisions
3. Exploit xStats gaps to find buy-low opportunities
4. Avoid the temptation to chase "name" players past their prime

**The edge exists. The question is: which teams will exploit it?**

## Appendix: Data Sources & Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Baseball Savant** - Expected stats (xBA, xSLG, xwOBA), barrel rate, exit velocity
- **FanGraphs** - WAR, wRC+, FIP, K%, BB%, season stats
- **MLB.com** - 2025 free agent list and WAR estimates
- **Internal Analysis** - Aging curves, contract projections, value scoring

### Analysis Date
November 13, 2025 (immediately following 2025 World Series)

### Aging Curve Methodology
- Historical player performance data (2000-2025)
- Position-specific regression models
- Peak age and decline rate calculations
- Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty quantification

### Contract Valuation Formula
```
Fair Value = Σ(Projected WAR × $/WAR × Inflation Factor) for contract length
Where:
- Projected WAR = Current WAR × (1 - Decline Rate)^year
- $/WAR = $8.0M (2025-26 baseline)
- Inflation Factor = 1.05^year (5% annual increase)
```

### Value Score Components
1. **Current performance** (40%) - 2025 WAR percentile rank
2. **Expected stats gap** (30%) - xwOBA - wOBA (scaled ±30 points)
3. **Age/prime years** (20%) - Age-based bonus (peak at 27-29)
4. **Quality of contact** (10%) - Barrel rate / whiff rate percentile

### Limitations
- 2025 season data may not be fully published yet (using best available estimates)
- Contract projections assume health and no major skill changes
- Market dynamics (bidding wars, team needs) can override analytical valuations
- Individual player context (clubhouse fit, positional scarcity) not fully captured
