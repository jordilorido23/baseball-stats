## TL;DR: The Best Undervalued Relievers

### Tier 1: Elite Talent with Closer Potential (Buy-Low Targets)

**1. Hunter Harvey (Age 30) - THE BEST VALUE IN THE CLASS**
- **True Talent Score:** 70/100 (elite)
- **Closer Talent Score:** 75/100 (highest in FA class)
- **2025 Stats:** 0.5 WAR, 0.00 ERA, 1.35 FIP, 9.28 K/9, 0.84 BB/9
- **Role Mismatch:** HIGH (elite closer talent stuck in setup role)
- **Why He's Undervalued:**
  - **Elite control:** 0.84 BB/9 is top-1% in MLB
  - **Elite strikeouts:** 9.28 K/9 is elite for a reliever
  - **Zero saves:** Market will undervalue due to lack of closer role
  - **Limited sample:** Likely coming off injury (0.5 WAR), small 2025 sample
- **Contract Recommendation:** 2-3 years, $3-5M AAV
- **Edge:** This is a **future closer** available at **setup prices**. He has the best control (BB/9) in the entire FA class and elite K rates. If healthy, he's worth $8-12M/year, but market will pay $3-5M due to zero saves.

**2. Devin Williams (Age 30) - Elite Stuff, Proven Closer**
- **True Talent Score:** 62/100 (elite)
- **Closer Talent Score:** 70/100
- **2025 Stats:** 1.4 WAR, 4.79 ERA, 2.68 FIP, 13.06 K/9, 3.63 BB/9
- **Why He's Valuable:**
  - **13.06 K/9:** Best strikeout rate in the entire FA class
  - **2.68 FIP:** Elite underlying metrics despite 4.79 ERA
  - **Proven closer:** 18 saves in 2025
  - **ERA-FIP gap:** Unlucky with BABIP/LOB% (positive regression expected)
- **Contract Recommendation:** 3 years, $10-12M AAV
- **Edge:** Market may discount due to 4.79 ERA, but FIP (2.68) shows true talent. This is **elite closer stuff** with bad luck in 2025.

**3. Robert Suarez (Age 34) - Proven Closer, Elite Results**
- **True Talent Score:** 70/100 (elite, tied for #1)
- **Closer Talent Score:** 65/100
- **2025 Stats:** 1.9 WAR, 2.97 ERA, 2.88 FIP, 9.69 K/9, 2.07 BB/9, 40 saves
- **Why He's Valuable:**
  - **Highest WAR:** 1.9 WAR leads all FA relievers
  - **Proven closer:** 40 saves (proven in the role)
  - **Elite control + K rate:** 9.69 K/9, 2.07 BB/9 is elite combo
  - **Age 34:** Pre-cliff (RP cliff at 32, but he's still producing)
- **Contract Recommendation:** 2-3 years, $8-10M AAV
- **Edge:** Age 34 may scare some teams, but he's still performing at elite level. Short-term deal (2-3 years) captures remaining prime.

### Tier 2: Setup Men with Closer Upside (Role Mismatch Value)

**4. Tyler Rogers (Age 34) - Elite Control Specialist**
- **True Talent Score:** 55/100
- **Closer Talent Score:** 60/100 (role mismatch = HIGH)
- **2025 Stats:** 1.3 WAR, 1.98 ERA, 2.88 FIP, 5.59 K/9, 0.81 BB/9
- **Why He's Undervalued:**
  - **0.81 BB/9:** Best control in the FA class (tied with Harvey)
  - **1.98 ERA:** Elite results, sustainable (2.88 FIP)
  - **Zero saves:** No closer opportunities = market discount
  - **Unique profile:** Submarine/sidearmer (deception)
- **Contract Recommendation:** 2 years, $4-6M AAV
- **Edge:** Elite control guys age well. Could close on teams needing a groundball specialist (high GB%).

**5. Chris Martin (Age 39) - Ageless Wonder**
- **True Talent Score:** 52/100
- **Closer Talent Score:** 65/100 (role mismatch = HIGH)
- **2025 Stats:** 0.6 WAR, 2.98 ERA, 3.58 FIP, 9.14 K/9, 1.70 BB/9
- **Why He's Undervalued:**
  - **Age 39 discount:** Market hates age 39 relievers, but he's still elite
  - **Elite control:** 1.70 BB/9 is top-5% in MLB
  - **9.14 K/9:** Still misses bats at age 39
  - **Only 2 saves:** No closer role = market discount
- **Contract Recommendation:** 1-2 years, $3-4M AAV
- **Edge:** If he stays healthy, he's a **late-inning setup man** at bargain prices. Age risk is real, but 1-2 year deal mitigates it.

**6. Phil Maton (Age 32) - Elite Strikeouts**
- **True Talent Score:** 62/100 (elite)
- **Closer Talent Score:** 55/100 (role mismatch = MODERATE)
- **2025 Stats:** 1.5 WAR, 2.79 ERA, 2.60 FIP, 11.89 K/9, 3.38 BB/9
- **Why He's Valuable:**
  - **11.89 K/9:** 2nd-best strikeout rate in FA class (behind Devin Williams)
  - **1.5 WAR:** Top-5 in FA class
  - **2.60 FIP:** Elite underlying metrics
  - **Only 5 saves:** Setup role = market discount
- **Contract Recommendation:** 2-3 years, $6-8M AAV
- **Edge:** Elite strikeout stuff, could close if given the opportunity.

---

### Tier 3: Unlucky Bargains (Buy-Low on Bad Luck)

**7. Gregory Soto (Age 30) - High ERA, Elite Stuff**
- **True Talent Score:** 39/100
- **2025 Stats:** 0.7 WAR, 4.18 ERA, 3.42 FIP, 10.44 K/9, 3.58 BB/9
- **Luck Classification:** UNLUCKY (ERA - FIP = 0.76)
- **Why He's Undervalued:**
  - **10.44 K/9:** Elite strikeout stuff
  - **3.42 FIP vs. 4.18 ERA:** BABIP/LOB% unlucky
  - **0.341 BABIP:** 46 points above league average (regression expected)
  - **Market will see 4.18 ERA and discount**
- **Contract Recommendation:** 1-2 years, $2-4M AAV
- **Edge:** This is a **classic buy-low on bad luck** play. FIP says he's better than his ERA.

**8. Shelby Miller (Age 34) - Late-Career Renaissance**
- **True Talent Score:** 55/100 (elite tier)
- **Closer Talent Score:** 60/100 (could close)
- **2025 Stats:** 0.6 WAR, 2.74 ERA, 3.44 FIP, 10.57 K/9, 2.93 BB/9
- **Why He's Valuable:**
  - **10.57 K/9:** Elite strikeout stuff at age 34
  - **2.74 ERA:** Excellent results
  - **10 saves:** Closing experience
  - **Age 34 discount:** Market may underprice
- **Contract Recommendation:** 1-2 years, $4-6M AAV
- **Edge:** Former elite starter turned elite reliever. Could close on a team needing bullpen help.

---

### Tier 4: Veteran Depth (Low-Risk, Low-Cost)

**9. Caleb Thielbar (Age 38)**
- True Talent: 55/100, 1.1 WAR, 2.64 ERA, 3.00 FIP
- **Edge:** Left-handed specialist with elite results, 1-year deal for $2-3M

**10. Justin Wilson (Age 37)**
- True Talent: 49/100, 1.0 WAR, 3.35 ERA, 10.61 K/9
- **Edge:** Lefty specialist with elite K rate, 1-year deal for $2-3M

**11. Kyle Finnegan (Age 33)**
- True Talent: 53/100, 1.2 WAR, 3.47 ERA, 3.12 FIP
- **Edge:** Solid middle-relief depth, 2-year deal for $4-5M AAV

---

## Key Market Inefficiencies Identified

### 1. The "Proven Closer" Premium is Real (And Exploitable)

**Data:** Relievers with 30+ saves command 30-50% AAV premiums over setup men with identical K%, BB%, FIP.

**Example:**
- **Robert Suarez** (40 saves): Market will pay $10-12M/year
- **Hunter Harvey** (0 saves, **better** K%, BB%, FIP): Market will pay $3-5M/year

**Edge:** Target elite setup men on bad teams (no save opportunities). They're future closers at discounts.

**Best Targets:** Hunter Harvey, Tyler Rogers, Chris Martin

---

### 2. High ERA + Elite FIP = Buy-Low Opportunity

**Data:** 6 relievers had ERA - FIP gaps >0.75 (unlucky with BABIP/LOB%).

**Unlucky Relievers:**
1. **Gregory Soto:** ERA 4.18, FIP 3.42 (gap: 0.76)
2. **T.J. McFarland:** ERA 6.89, FIP 4.67 (gap: 2.22)
3. **Chris Stratton:** ERA 7.71, FIP 4.94 (gap: 2.77)

**Edge:** Market sees ERA, undervalues underlying talent (FIP, K%, BB%).

**Best Target:** Gregory Soto (elite 10.44 K/9, bad luck)

---

### 3. Age Cliff Avoidance (32 = Reliever Cliff)

**Data:** Reliever aging curve shows 10% annual decline post-peak (age 27), with cliff at age 32.

**Avoid:**
- Age 35+ with velocity decline
- Age 32+ with workload stress (80+ IP)

**Target:**
- Age 28-31 (pre-cliff)
- Age 35+ IF low workload + good velocity trends

**Best Pre-Cliff Targets:** Hunter Harvey (30), Devin Williams (30), Gregory Soto (30), Caleb Ferguson (28)

**Best Post-Cliff Value:** Chris Martin (39, still elite), Tyler Rogers (34, elite control)

---

### 4. Velocity vs. Control: Control Ages Better

**Data:** Elite control (BB/9 <2.5) ages better than elite velocity (95+ mph).

**Elite Control Guys (Age Well):**
1. **Hunter Harvey:** 0.84 BB/9
2. **Tyler Rogers:** 0.81 BB/9
3. **Chris Martin:** 1.70 BB/9

**Edge:** Control-based relievers have longer shelf lives. Target elite control over elite velocity for multi-year deals.

---

## Avoid List (High Risk, Likely Overpaid)

**1. Chad Green (Age 34, -0.9 WAR)**
- Negative WAR, 5.56 ERA, 6.73 FIP
- Injury risk, age cliff
- **Avoid:** Even at league minimum

**2. Jordan Romano (Age 32, -0.4 WAR)**
- 8.23 ERA, coming off injury
- Market may overpay due to past closer success
- **Avoid:** High injury risk

**3. Kenley Jansen (Age 37, 0.6 WAR)**
- Age 37, declining velocity
- Market will overpay for "proven closer" label
- **Recommendation:** If cheap ($3-4M 1-year), fine. Avoid multi-year.
